Built 2D Shape Editor Web Application using Konvajs opensource library.
I have implemented the 2D-shape editor for the following shapes:

Circle
Ellipse
Pentagon
Hexagon

Bezier Curve
I have also implemented the below mentioned transformations for the above mentioned shapes:
Selection

Rotation
I have also implemented:
Save diagrams to file—JSON format
Load diagrams from file—JSON format
Save as image—JPEG format
Save as PDF
Draw grid
Thickness

Text

Zoom-in/Zoom-out

I have used the konva.js library for drawing and transforming shapes, saving and loading canvas as JSON.

I have used jsPDF library for exporting the canvas as PDF.

I have used Colors.js library for color manipulations.

A couple of helpful resources that I used to implement the project was W3Schools, Stack Overflow and CSS tooltips.
I also watched a couple of videos on YouTube to learn how to use the library and the library docs had a lot of helpful tutorials and demos to refer.
